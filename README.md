# DiagramDetective 🕵🏾‍♀️

A Qt/C++ desktop application for chasing diagrammatic proofs such as for the Snake Lemma in Homological Algebra.

## Features
1. A monoid is modeled as a category with one object, ie. not strictly as a set with an associative binary op.
2. Definitions are recursive, so for example the morphisms in a monoid could very well be functors and so on...
3. Ability to take functorial images within a diagram chaser scene and auto-update the image labels as the input diagram changes.
4. Support for abstract abelian category diagram chases as well as "taking elements."
